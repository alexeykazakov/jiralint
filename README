Experiment where I'm trying to use Hudson for early warnings/errors in jiras.

README     	     this file
jira-cli-4.2/ 	     python Jira Command line interface modified to have custom rendering and direct username/password settings.
testcase-render.py   render function that exports junit.xml style for every jira found in a report
jbosstools.sh        Script used for testing jbosstools jira filters

Steps to use it:

1. Create named filter(s) in your jira that mathces the jira's you
   want to show up as test errors, i.e. I use "ToolsIllegalFixVersion"
   which JQL is:

  ((project = JBIDE and (fixVersion in ("3.1.x","3.2.x", "LATER") or
  fixVersion is empty)) or (project = JBDS and (fixVersion in
  ("3.0.x", "4.0.x", "LATER") or fixVersion is empty))) and resolution
  = done and updatedDate >= "-90d"

   Which basically shows all completed issues in JBIDE or JBDS which
   fixVersion were not specified or an illegal fixVersion were used
   (we use .x and LATER to designate "planned" issues).

2. Test the filter in jira web-ui and see it return results and now run this:

   cd jira-cli-4.2/
   ./jira -s ${JIRA_HOST} -u ${JIRA_USER} -p ${JIRA_PWD} report ${REPORT_NAME}

   (remember to put proper values here for JIRA_* and REPORT_NAME)

   If this give a list that matches what you see in the jira web-ui you got the core working.

3. Setup a Hudson build which executes the following:

   cd jira-cli-4.2/
   ./jira -s ${JIRA_HOST} -u ${JIRA_USER} -p ${JIRA_PWD} -r ../testcase-render.py report ToolsIllegalFixVersion > $WORKSPACE/jiralint-test.xml

   You should fill out the JIRA_* names or use the Masked Password and/or Build Parameters plugin in hudson to pass them in.

   The difference here is that we use the testcase-render.py to get testcase output instead.

4. Enable "Publish JUnit test result report" in the Hudson job and set it to include "**/*-test.xml so it matches the jiralint-test.xml file, i.e. "**/*-test.xml"

5. Run the build

Now you should get a failed build if there are any jiras matching your filter.

Have fun!
