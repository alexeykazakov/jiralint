Experiment where I'm trying to use Jenkins for early warnings/error detection in jiras.

README     	     this file
render-testcase.py   takes a report.json to render jira query results into junit.xml test reports   
*.json               reports used by JBoss Tools team for detecting stale/non-triaged/incorrect jiras

Steps to use it:

1. Create a <reportname>.json file with the following format:

  ```
  [
  {
    "nofixversion": {
	"jql": "(project = JBIDE AND fixVersion is EMPTY AND createdDate <= -7d",
        "description": "Issues have no fix version and was created 7 dags ago. Please triage."
    }
  },
  {
    "nocomponent": {
      "jql": "project in (JBIDE,JBDS) AND component is EMPTY AND resolution is EMPTY",
      "description": "Issue has no component - please triage and make sure it is put in the right component or set of components."
    }
  }
  ]
  ```
  
  Each entry has a report name used for identifying its results and then a jql for the query and finally a description which is added to each jira "error" message.
  
2. Test it by running:

   ```
   $ python -u user -p secret -s jiraserver -r <reportname>.json
   ```

   Now for each report a -test.xml file will be created containing "test failures" for each jira matching the result.

3. Setup a Jenkins build which executes the above script and enable junit reporting and you got automatic notification and tracking to help improve your jira content.

Have fun!
